Project Title: 
Online Quiz

Motivation:

I made this online quiz to experiment with various aspects of web development.


Screenshots:

There is a folder including screenshots of the page in use as well as screenshots of important parts of the js and html.

How to use:

When you click the "Go!" button, the quiz will begin.

You will be given a multiple choice question where the possible answers are buttons.

If you click the button corresponding to the correct answer, it will say "correct!" (in red) and it will progress to the next question.

If you click on an incorrect answer, it will say "incorrect!" and progress to the next question.

The quiz will be timed and correct answers will be awarded 10 points each.

The time remaining and the points accrued will be listed in the upper left.

This will be repeated until all questions are answered.

If time runs out before completing the quiz, the user will be alerted with a message saying "Time's Up!". The user will then input their score.

When all the questions are answered, the user will be prompted to input their initials.

The initials along with their score on the quiz (10 points for every correct answer), will then be listed on the Leaderboard.

To go back to the beginning of the quiz, you can click on the "Quiz" link in the upper left.

If you want to go from the home page to the Leaderboard, click on the "Leaderboard" link in the upper left.
