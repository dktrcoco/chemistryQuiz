Assignment 4 Pseudo-Code

I want a website that when first loaded, displays the instructions of a multiple choice quiz.

There will be a link that will take the user to the recorded scores for previous quiz-takers.

There will be a START button that when clicked will display the first question and begin the timer.

There will be buttons for each multiple choice option.

When any button is clicked, the page will indicate if the question was answered correctly or not.

The next question will immediately display after submitting the answer to the previous question.

When an incorrect answer is chosen, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer.

When a correct answer is chosen, 10 points will be added to the score.

When time runs out, the quiz will end and the user will be prompted to enter their initials for the Leaderboard.

When the quiz is completed, the user will be prompted to enter their initials for the leaderboard.

After entering initials, the leaderboard will be displayed as a list of initials with corresponding scores.

A link will be available to retake the quiz.
